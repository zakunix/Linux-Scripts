# Linux-Scripts
This repository contains a collection of Linux scripts that Iâ€™ve written and/or used for various purposes. While they were created with specific distributions in mind, they may also work on others with minimal modification.

Scripts are organized by the distribution they were originally developed or tested on. Please note that functionality may vary depending on your system configuration.
